# Welcome to FreaksAI
In this repository, you'll find everything about the FreaksAI program in FreaksLabor.

```markdown
# How it works
This concept works with Tensorflow Lite,      
which is compatible with almost every mobile phone and more...
```

```markdown
# How can I use it?
It is really simple!     
You download just the model and that should be it!      
All the features in FreaksLabor are in your hands now :D
```

```markdown
# Do you save data from other devices?
NO!
I don't use data from other devices and environments.      
I train the AI with locally saved data and every mobile phone       
could behave differently and show other results.
I will not send any data to anywhere just to train the AI+.        
```
